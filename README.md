An Arduino/GPS controller to automatically deploy and retract your actuator controlled DIY wake gates/tabs at apprioriate speeds.

Depends on https://github.com/SlashDevin/NeoGPS/

If you are not using an Arduino Mega 2560 you'll also need either https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/AltSoftSerial or https://github.com/SlashDevin/NeoSWSerial

# Parts List (Simple):
Pick an Arduino:
* Uno R3 (https://www.amazon.com/ATmega328P-Development-Compatible-Develope-Microcontroller/dp/B01AR7YJ3O)
OR
* Nano: https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-ATmega328P-Micro-controller-Development-Compatible/dp/B00E87VWY4/

If you want a screw shield instead of soldering (recommended), the nano is likely a better option (https://www.amazon.com/Aideepen-Terminal-Adapter-Expansion-ATMEGA328P-AU/dp/B0788MLRLK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527559143&sr=8-1&keywords=nano+screw+shield)

* L298N Motor Bridge (https://www.amazon.com/Stepper-Controller-Mega2560-Duemilanove-IFANCY-TECH/dp/B01GZ1QUHO  (only need 1, but a backup doesn't hurt)

* LM2596 Buck Converter (https://www.amazon.com/eBoot-LM2596-Converter-3-0-40V-1-5-35V/dp/B01GJ0SC2C (only need 1 but they are super handy and cheap)

* GPS Module with antenna (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MRNN3YZ) 

* Any 3 way switch you want (SPDT - not momentary) - IE: https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Sea-Systems-WeatherDeck-Toggle/dp/B000MMFJ02

* If you want a status LED grab one you like (9v - 12v)
